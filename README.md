The swiss german YouTube video about the project is located [here](https://youtu.be/LLqfkt4jdq0).

The used OneWire temperature sensor is DS1820. I ordered them form [AliExpress](https://de.aliexpress.com/item/Free-Shipping-1PCS-Digital-Temperature-Temp-Sensor-Probe-DS18B20-For-Thermometer-1m-Waterproof-100CM/32522322459.html).

Attention: Currently, the electronic schema is missing.
